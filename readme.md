PROGRAM:       SUBSTITUTION DECODER
WRITTEN BY:    MICHAEL GIANCOLA

DESCRIPTION:   Decodes given text file, either by frequency analysis or using a Caesar cypher (not available yet). Eventually, I plan to allow the user to specify their own frequency table.


Release Notes:
8/6/15 - Wrote a bunch of code for Frequency Analysis. It almost works.. sort of. Okay not at all. It runs and creates a file, but there is something wrong with the frequency table.


Usage Notes:
- Program ignores any non-letter characters, including numbers and spaces. They will not
be present in the output.
- "make clean" destroys output files.

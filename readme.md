# Substitution Decoder
Decodes given text file, either by frequency analysis or using a Caesar cipher (not available yet). Eventually, I plan to allow the user to specify their own frequency table.

#### Release Notes:
##### 8/6/15 :
Wrote a bunch of code for Frequency Analysis. It almost works.. sort of. Okay not at all. It runs and creates a file, but there is something wrong with the frequency table.


#### Usage Notes:
- Program ignores any non-letter characters, including numbers and spaces. They will not be present in the output.
- "make clean" destroys output files.
